# Overview

{The purpose of this project is to create a way for someone to store and track movies, tv shows, books etc. that they desire to enjoy at a later point in time. I hope that in the future I will be able to apply what I learn from this project to make a clean and organized platform for this same purpose.}

{The application at its current state allows the user to type in a new item to store in a database, however I wasn’t able to get the database set up correctly the user input doesn’t get stored anywhere. The prompt for the user input is triggered by tapping on the icon in the bottom right of the screen. The input cannot be entered empty and requires something to be entered. }

# Development Environment

{The main program that I used to write the code for this project was Android Studio. Once the code was written I used VisualStudioCode to update the github repository.}

{I found the Java programming language to be very similar to C++ and the little experience I had in it was very useful. The different libraries I attempted to use include RecyclerView, SQLiteDatabase, android, DialogInterface, and some other smaller.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Get the Database to work
* Add more pages seperating shows, movies, and watched media
* The code itself is rather messy in in places and needs to be simplified and cleaned up.
