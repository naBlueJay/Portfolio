# Overview

This is a text based Choose Your Own Adventure game. I chose to write it using the Python Programming Language. The principle that I was attempting to learn and apply to this project was integrating external python program files to the main file  in order to streamline and maintain my code.

The min python file prints the main menu as well as generates the dungeon layout. Once the dungeon has been generated it calls each room file.

# Development Environment

Pretty much the only tool that I used to write the code for this project was Visual Studio Code. Other than that I used notepad to type out my text blocks.

# Future Work
* I would like to add an item list and item dictionary to allow for randomized item collection and a final score.
* I initially wanted to have two more rooms, but I ran out of time and was only able to code in 4 total rooms.
* I was having some problems with the code blocks and had a lot of print statements as a result. In the future I think I would like to restructure the program and either store the text blocks as external text documents, or variables.
