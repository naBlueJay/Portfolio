Room Types:
Three chests - 
    A room containing three chests (as the name implies). 
    There is a single key on the ground in front of the middle chest.
    Chest 1: Contains a mimmic (will kill the player if thy open it)
    Chest 2: Contains an item.
    Chest 3: Breaks the key and doesn't open.

    The chest placement will be random.

Escape Room - 
    A room that gives the player the choice to leave the dungeon with their treasure or continue gathering.

Two Doors - 
    A room containing two doors (as the name implies).
    Behind one door is a treasure. Once gathered, the player can continue on to the next room.
    Behind the second door is nothing but the next room.

Chasm -
    A large room wth a chest on a pillar of stone at the center of a chasm.
    The only way to access the chest is to cross a rickety roap bridge.
    There is also a path around the room that leads to the exit of the room.
    If the player decides to cross the bridge there is a chance the bridge will give out killing the player.

Beast Room -
    There is a large statue of a monster sleeping at the center of the room.
    resting on the beast is a small bag.
    The player has the choice to either skirt the edge of the room to the exit or risk retreiving the bag on the beast.

    If the player skirts the edge of the room there is a small chance they will wake the statue.

    If the player decides to retreive the item there is a high chance of waking the statue.

Potion Room -
    There is a potion placed on  a small pedestal at the center of the room.
    The player has the choice to either drink the potion or leave without item.
    If the player decides to drink the potion they will die (you shouldn't drink something you find in a dungeon... duh...).
