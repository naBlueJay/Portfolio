# Overview

## Question 1

### What is the most common dice combination?

From the data, I found the most common dice combination was 23456. I found it rather interesting that in the top three combinations two of which would give the player a large straight, and in the top five most common the other three were one-off from a large straight.

|    |    ID |   count |
|---:|------:|--------:|
|  0 | 23456 |     169 |
|  1 | 13456 |     167 |
|  2 | 12345 |     160 |
|  3 | 12356 |     152 |
|  4 | 12346 |     151 |
|  5 | 12456 |     143 |
|  6 | 13346 |      96 |
|  7 | 23466 |      92 |
|  8 | 23346 |      92 |
|  9 | 12556 |      90 |

## Question 2

### Using the data, what is the probability of getting any specific roll combination?

Of the 10,000 randomized rolls, there were 251 unique combinations. Using that the average rolls per unique combination were 39.846. Using that we can see that the chances of getting the desired roll, on your first roll, are around 00.398%.

# Development Environment

The two tools that I used for this project were Microsoft Excel and Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code was used to write my code and Microsoft Excel was used to clean up my generated data.

The programming language that I used for this project was Python. The main plugins that I used for this project were numpy, altair, and pandas. Numpy and pandas were the main tools used for my data manipulation and Altair was used for rendering out the graph for my data. 

# Useful Websites

The only website that I really used for support and assistance for this project was occasionally StackOverflow. There wasnâ€™t really a need to use any other.
